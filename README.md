# My Blog Test

This is my tech test for EWJAM. I built this using React, NextJS and styled components.

## Local Dev

To run this app locally, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Considerations and next steps

Considering the time frame, I focused on producing a simple blog website, with a basic re-usable and responsive design which would allow me to scale the application if I were to spend more time on this in the future. I used the create Next App CLI tool so that I didn't have to worry about the set up of the project and I could focus my efforts on the building of the app. If I had a bit more time I would have done the following:

- Stored the blog posts in a Json file for this exercise
- Added functionality to the search bar to filter posts based on title and description
